    description: "The Jaguar I-PACE is the brand's first all-electric vehicle, pioneering a new design language and engineering approach for Jaguar. Built on the JLR D7e electric vehicle platform, it features a distinctive cab-forward design that maximizes interior space while maintaining athletic proportions. The exterior combines SUV practicality with sports car influences, featuring a short hood, squared-off rear, and dramatic proportions enabled by the placement of batteries in the floor structure. Powered by dual permanent magnet synchronous electric motors providing all-wheel drive and a combined output of 394 HP (294 kW) and 512 lb-ft (694 Nm) of torque, it delivers 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.8 seconds with a top speed of 124 mph (electronically limited). The 90 kWh lithium-ion battery (432 pouch cells) offers an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (WLTP: up to 292 miles), with DC fast charging capability allowing 0-80% charge in approximately 40-45 minutes at 100 kW. The interior showcases a minimalist, modern design with a floating center console, and was initially equipped with the InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system. The absence of a traditional drivetrain creates a flat floor and generous interior space despite relatively compact exterior dimensions. Advanced features include adaptive air suspension, active air management, and Jaguar's Adaptive Surface Response for optimizing traction in various conditions. The I-PACE has received critical acclaim, winning the 2019 World Car of the Year, European Car of the Year, World Car Design of the Year, and World Green Car awards. It was discontinued in 2024 due to slowing sales and a change in corporate vision, marking the end of Jaguar's first mass-produced electric vehicle."
