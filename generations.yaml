    description: "The Jaguar I-PACE is the brand's first all-electric vehicle, pioneering a new design language and engineering approach for Jaguar. Built on a bespoke electric vehicle architecture, it features a distinctive cab-forward design that maximizes interior space while maintaining athletic proportions. The exterior combines SUV practicality with sports car influences, featuring a short hood, squared-off rear, and dramatic proportions enabled by the placement of batteries in the floor structure. Powered by dual electric motors providing all-wheel drive and a combined output of 394 HP (294 kW) and 512 lb-ft of torque, it delivers 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.5 seconds. The 90 kWh lithium-ion battery offers an EPA-estimated range of 234 miles (WLTP: 292 miles), with DC fast charging capability allowing a 0-80% charge in approximately 40 minutes at 100 kW. The interior showcases a minimalist, modern design with a floating center console, twin-screen InControl Touch Pro Duo infotainment system, and premium sustainable materials. The absence of a traditional drivetrain creates a flat floor and generous interior space despite relatively compact exterior dimensions. Advanced features include adaptive air suspension, active air management, and Jaguar's Adaptive Surface Response for optimizing traction in various conditions. A significant update in 2020 introduced an improved infotainment system (Pivi Pro), faster charging capability, and enhanced driver assistance systems without changing the fundamental design. The I-PACE has received critical acclaim, winning the 2019 World Car of the Year, World Car Design of the Year, and World Green Car awards, establishing Jaguar's credentials in the premium electric vehicle market and previewing the brand's future all-electric direction."
